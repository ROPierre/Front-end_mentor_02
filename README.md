In this solution I will try the [3-column preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/3column-preview-card-component-pH92eAR2-) challenge from Frontend Mentor as an exercise to fix concepts that I learned from flexbox.

## Overview

Simple solution of 3 column cards, using only the basics of HTML5 and CSS3 (with flexbox) 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- See how I did the challenge

## My process

First of all I planned the HTML, where everything was going to be and what I should do with every element there.
Secondly I started with just one of the cards because the other would have the same basics properties prioritizing the reponsive environment, small display screen to the large one.
At last I started to do the other cards and created the custom style properties of each one and started the desktop version, where the cards are in a row.  
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
